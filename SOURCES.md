# SOURCES

Provenance for every item in this archive: what it is, where the bytes came from, and how
faithful the copy is.

- **Byte-exact** — pulled unmodified from a genuine source: a live server still serving its
  stock default, an official repo/dist blob, or a real distro package.
- **Reconstructed** — the visible content is genuine, but some surrounding markup was
  rebuilt because the original bytes were not recoverable. Always noted.

Rights stay with each owner; see [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md) for the licensing, trademark, and
government-seal caveats. **Line endings:** IIS pages are **CRLF** (Windows originals); all
other pages are **LF**.

| Path | Version / OS | Files | Origin | Fidelity |
|------|--------------|-------|--------|----------|
| `iis-4.0_nt4-optionpack/` | IIS 4.0 / NT 4.0 Option Pack | `default.asp` | Prose, asset names, and link targets transcribed verbatim from live NT4 hosts still serving it (e.g. ridethesteamtrain.com, support.daggersec.com) | Reconstructed — text genuine, table/CSS skeleton approximate |
| `iis-5.x_win2000-xp/` | IIS 5.0/5.1 / Win 2000, XP | `iisstart.asp`, `localstart.asp`, `LOCALSTART.HTM`, `WINXP/WARNING/WEB/MMC/HELP/PRINT.GIF` | ASP header from an IIS box leaking its `.asp` source; body/CSS/JS + GIFs from an HTTrack mirror of a live IIS 5.1 box (`lexi.re/LOCALSTART.HTM`, signed 2024-06-22), resolved template expressions re-inserted | Genuine, assembled from two captures |
| `iis-6.0_server2003/` | IIS 6.0 / Server 2003 | `iisstart.htm`, `pagerror.gif` | "Under Construction" text verified against period captures | Reconstructed — text genuine, markup period-accurate rebuild |
| `iis-7.0_vista-server2008/` | IIS 7.0 / Vista, Server 2008 | `iisstart.htm` (689 B), `welcome.png` | Live server response + committed copy | Byte-exact |
| `iis-7.5_win7-server2008r2/` | IIS 7.5 / Win 7, Server 2008 R2 | `iisstart.htm`, `welcome.png` | Same page as 7.0 | Byte-exact |
| `iis-8.0_win8-server2012/` | IIS 8.0 / Win 8, Server 2012 | `iisstart.htm`, `bkg-blu.jpg`, `iis-8.png`, `msweb-brand.png`, `w-brand.png` | Genuine install / live response | Byte-exact |
| `iis-8.5_win81-server2012r2/` | IIS 8.5 / Win 8.1, Server 2012 R2 | `iisstart.htm`, `iis-85.png` | Genuine install / live response | Byte-exact |
| `iis-10_win10-client/` | IIS 10 / Windows 10 | `iisstart.htm`, `iis.png` | Genuine install / live response | Byte-exact |
| `iis-10_server2016plus/` | IIS 10 / Server 2016, 2019, 2022 | `iisstart.htm` (703 B), `iisstart.png` | Genuine install / live response | Byte-exact |
| `iis-assets/` | shared IIS image assets | `bkg-blu.jpg`, `iis-8.png`, `iis-85.png`, `iis.png`, `iisstart.png`, `msweb-brand.png`, `w-brand.png`, `welcome.png`, `ws8-brand.png` | Collected from genuine installs / live responses | Byte-exact (binaries) |
| `iis-5.x_win2000-xp/IISHELP/COMMON/` | IIS Help "Legal Information" page (5.x era) | `COLEGAL.HTM`, `COUA.CSS` | HTTrack mirror of a live IIS box's `/iishelp/common/colegal.htm` (`lexi.re`, 2024-06-22), same capture as the `iis-5.x` pages; linked from `localstart` via `IISHELP/COMMON/COLEGAL.HTM`. Carries Microsoft's own "© 1997–2001 Microsoft Corporation" legal/trademark text | Genuine capture, **cleaned**: HTTrack mirror comments and an injected `protonpass-root` browser-extension artifact removed, stylesheet link repointed to the sibling `COUA.CSS`. The non-IE4 sheet `COCSS.CSS` its script also references was not recovered |

IIS 1.0–3.0 default pages are **not recoverable** and are documented, not shipped — see
`IIS-4.0-and-earlier-FINDINGS.md`. There is no IIS 9 (Microsoft jumped 8.5 → 10).
